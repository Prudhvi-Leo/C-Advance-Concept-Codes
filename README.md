# Full Stack C# Web Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my comprehensive learning repository where I am documenting my journey into the depths of full stack web development with C#. This repository is a collection of my practical experiments, projects, and notes as I dive into various aspects of ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and related technologies.

## Introduction
This repository serves as a record of my journey as I learn and implement full stack web development using C#. The goal is to master both the backend and frontend aspects of web applications, focusing primarily on ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. Each commit represents a new lesson learned and applied in practical projects.

## Learning Topics

### ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications. The topics I am covering include:

- **Middleware**: Customizing request and response pipelines.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing security using various authentication schemes and authorization policies.
- **Routing**: Configuring URL patterns and mapping them to actions.
- **MVC**: Model-View-Controller pattern for creating web applications.
- **Dependency Injection**: Managing application services and their lifetimes.
- **Data Annotations**: Validating model data using attributes.
- **Filters and Attributes**: Applying cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, and authorization.

### Entity Framework Core
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is an object-database mapper for .NET. The topics I am exploring include:

- **Relationships**: Defining and managing entity relationships.
- **Entity Filters API**: Filtering data at the entity level.
- **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Executing database stored procedures and functions.
- **Migrations**: Managing database schema changes.
- **Bulk Operations**: Performing efficient bulk inserts, updates, and deletes.
- **Loading**: Eager, lazy, and explicit loading of related data.

### CRUD Operations
Learning and implementing Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations is fundamental for any web application. I am practicing these operations extensively across different modules.

### ASP.NET Core Web API
ASP.NET Core Web API is a framework for building HTTP services that can be accessed from any client including browsers and mobile devices. Topics covered include:

- Building RESTful APIs.
- Handling HTTP requests and responses.
- Implementing API versioning, documentation, and testing.
